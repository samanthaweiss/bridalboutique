    <h2>Blakely</h2>
    <p>	We had such a fabulous time working with Blakely to find her dream wedding gown! She knew she wanted something timeless and elegant with a detailed twist, and this Lela Rose gown she chose was the total package! </p>
    <pullquote>	"My favorite parts were the laser detail and the ruffle on the back. I think this gown was the perfect mix of my classic, traditional side with a little flare!"

    <h2>Catherine</h2>
    <p>We had such a wonderful experience working with Catherine to find her perfect Monique Lhuillier gown! Being a dancer, Catherine wanted to incorporate her professional passion into her bridal portraits and the results are absolutely stunning! The pointe shoes are such a classically beautiful touch. We love a bride who embraces her personal style, and Catherine was all smiles and sparkles on her big day! Plus, check out how flawlessly she's working that bold red lip!
