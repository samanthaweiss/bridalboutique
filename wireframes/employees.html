    <h2>Barb Kuhn</h2>
    <strong>Boutique Manager and Owner</strong>
    <p>A driving force in the process of Barb opening own boutique has been a
      piece of advice from her grandmother: never settle. When she decided
      it was time for her to pursue her passion, Barb decided to follow her
      heart and open Barb's Bridal Boutique.</p>
