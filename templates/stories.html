    <h4>Blakely</h4>
    <p>	We had such a fabulous time working with Blakely to find her dream wedding gown! She knew she wanted something timeless and elegant with a detailed twist, and this Lela Rose gown she chose was the total package! </p>
    <pullquote>	"My favorite parts were the laser detail and the ruffle on the back. I think this gown was the perfect mix of my classic, traditional side with a little flare!"

    <p>	The bride elected to wait to see her father until the moment before he walked her down the aisle, and the expression on his face says it all! He looks thrilled to see his daughter looking absolutely stunning in her wedding gown!
    </p>
    <p>Congratulations, Blakely, you were a positively radiant bride!

    <h4>Catherine</h4>
    <p>We had such a wonderful experience working with Catherine to find her perfect Monique Lhuillier gown! Being a dancer, Catherine wanted to incorporate her professional passion into her bridal portraits and the results are absolutely stunning! The pointe shoes are such a classically beautiful touch. We love a bride who embraces her personal style, and Catherine was all smiles and sparkles on her big day! Plus, check out how flawlessly she's working that bold red lip!
