    <h4>Blakely</h4>
    <p>	We had such a fabulous time working with Blakely to find her dream wedding gown!
      She knew she wanted something timeless and elegant with a detailed twist, and this
      Lela Rose gown she chose was the total package! </p>
    <pullquote>"My favorite parts were the laser detail and the ruffle on the back. I
      think this gown was the perfect mix of my classic, traditional side with a little flare!"

    <h4>Catherine</h4>
    <div class="text">
    <p>We had such a wonderful experience working with Catherine to find her
      perfect Monique Lhuillier gown! Being a dancer, Catherine wanted to incorporate
      her professional passion into her bridal portraits and the results are absolutely
      stunning! The pointe shoes are such a classically beautiful touch. We love a bride
      who embraces her personal style, and Catherine was all smiles and sparkles on her
      big day! Plus, check out how flawlessly she's working that bold red lip!
    </p>
    <p>Congratulations, Catherine, you were such an exquisite bride!

    <pullquote>It was important to me that my dress matched the look and feel of our venue.
    This gown was absolutely perfect for our Savannah wedding at The Mansion on Forsyth Park
    - romantic, distinctive, elegant and timeless."
